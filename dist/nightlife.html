            <h1>Hard Rock Cafe Oslo</h1>
            <p>Restaurant, bar and night club that combines modern Scandinavian 
                design with the classic Hard Rock style, good 
                food and unique atmosphere.</p>

            <h1>The Dubliner</h1>
            <p>The Dubliner is one of the oldest and most authentic Irish pubs in Oslo. 
                Housed in a building from the 1700s, the crowd here varies from early 
                20s to the late middle-aged, but mostly they are from Oslo's Irish and 
                British neighbourhoods. There is a large selection of typical Irish 
                beers on tap and pub food on offer including favourites like fish & chips, 
                Guinness steak and a carvery. It is also a great music pub with traditional 
                and contemporary Irish music played on Friday and Saturday. On Tuesdays, the 
                pub holds you enthralled with its live ‘jam sessions', where local musicians are 
                free to join in with their guitars and the likes.</p>

            <h1>The Villa</h1>
            <p>This is the best place in Oslo if you are serious about your raving. 
                Techno, House and everything in between is best at The Villa. As 
                close to a Berlin underground Techno club you can get in Oslo. 
                No fancy entrance or signage – just a door in the wall. </p>
